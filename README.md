This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript for interactivity.

This deliverable demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements for structure, basic formatting, input, output, links, and drawing.

I learned that Javascript is not as hard to approach as I thought it would be, especially with the controls for the login. I say that because I'm taking CS240 right now and we had to build a server from scratch for an Ancestry.com type app and seeing the code for the javascript storage for login info it was so much simpler to do. 


Something I learned more about during this assingment is how Node.js is working. I sound like a broken record by this point, but I loved in the case with this code how easy it was to deploy all of my files as a services and store names in the database because I had to do it a different way when I was working over the summer at a tech internship where I had to use Apple Cloud and SwiftUI and I didn't really understand what it was doing, but for this it made more sense for what the service actually is

Something I learned about this assigment is the ins and outs of connecting a service to the database. I had a lot of problems with connecting my database at first because I wasn't allowing the right IP's to connect in so I learned a lot about how to pay attention to detail and the consequences of not allowing the right ips to be able to access the database. I also learned how to organize incoming data from a program and I thought it was super interesting how MongoDB and other databases for that better knows how to separate incoming data to collections and organizes very cleanly

Something I learned about is how cool it is to have conversations with websocket. I remember during work over the summer I first learned how websockets worked and loved how cool the idea of talking back and forth between a website as if it were a person was really cool. In the case with simon, it was interesting to learn how to debug it and learn how to generate the popups like "Game connected" to verify that as a user you are properly synced to the web application

I learned that Javascript is not as hard to approach as I thought it would be, especially with the controls for the login. I say that because I'm taking CS240 right now and we had to build a server from scratch for an Ancestry.com type app and seeing the code for the javascript storage for login info it was so much simpler to do. 


Something I learned more about during this assingment is how Node.js is working. I sound like a broken record by this point, but I loved in the case with this code how easy it was to deploy all of my files as a services and store names in the database because I had to do it a different way when I was working over the summer at a tech internship where I had to use Apple Cloud and SwiftUI and I didn't really understand what it was doing, but for this it made more sense for what the service actually is
